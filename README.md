# Onchain Frame Lib

This is a creative technical project to give a glimpse into the possibilities of true unstoppable interoperable NFTs.

This project demonstrates usage of the onchain frame library to decode a onchain NFT and compose it into a new NFT, all within a smart contract with ZERO offchain code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm i
npx hardhat test
```
